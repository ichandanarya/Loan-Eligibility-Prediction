# Loan Eligibility Prediction 

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether an applicant is eligible for a loan based on various features such as income, employment status, education, loan amount, and more.


## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a classification model that helps financial institutions decide whether to approve or reject a loan application. The model is trained using historical data of applicants and their loan status.

* ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term
* Credit_History, Property_Area
* Target variable : Loan_Status
## 🚀 Getting Started

* Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/Loan-Eligibility-Prediction.git
cd Loan-Eligibility-Prediction


```
* Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
* Open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Loan Eligibility Prediction.ipynb"


```
## ✅ Results

* Achieved X% accuracy on the test dataset (replace X% with your result)

* Insights from EDA help in better feature engineering for future models
## 📌 Future Improvements

* Try different classification algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

* Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

* Deploy model using Streamlit or Flask
